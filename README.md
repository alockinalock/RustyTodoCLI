# What is RustyTodoCLI?

RustyTodoCLI is a command line interface application which acts like a TODO planner.

This application can be interacted with in the terminal after it's executable has been ran. RustyTodoCLI also is persistent and therefore the user can close and reopen the application while maintaing all their data.

# Features

Naturally, RustyTodoCLI should have all the features you'd expect in a TODO planner. Some features may be missing, please request for them to be added if so.

* Data saves between sessions
* Add, remove, and rename tasks
* Easy to understand user interface and experience

# Limitations

Due to the nature of this app being a planner, it is most likely compared to apps such as Notion. In this scenario, this command line application loses.

* I am a solo developer so I can't make a fully fleshed out application with every single nook and cranny covered (I'll try though)
* What may be intuitive for me, may be unintuitive to someone else. Such is the nature of opinions. I will try my best to accommodate everyone's opinions.
